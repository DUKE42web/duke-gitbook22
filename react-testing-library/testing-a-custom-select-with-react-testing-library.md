# ðŸ•µâ™‚ Testing a Custom Select with React Testing Library

I have been following the community around [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/react) for a while now. One of the questions that come up more often is how to test a custom select component.

By _custom select_ I mean a component like [`react-select`'s](https://react-select.com/home), [Ant Design's](https://ant.design/components/select/) or [Material-UI's](https://material-ui.com/api/select/).

Material-UI's select

A large number of projects need a custom select. At first sight, they seem simple components, but in reality, they are quite complex. They need to take care of many use-cases and support accessibility features.

Suppose you wrote a new component that uses `react-select`:

```
function MySelector() {
  const options = [
    { value: "red", label: "Red" },
    { value: "green", label: "Green" },
    { value: "blue", label: "Blue" },
  ];
  const [color, setColor] = React.useState(options[0]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Your favorite color is {color.label}</h1>
      <Select
        options={options}
        value={color}
        onChange={(value) => {
          console.log(value);
          setColor(value);
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

`MySelector` in action

Testing `MySelector` is not as easy at it seems:

```
test("Naive test that doesn't work", () => {
  render(<MySelector />);
  expect(screen.getByText("Your favorite color is Red")).toBeInTheDocument();
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText("Red"));
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText("Green"));
  expect(screen.getByText("Your favorite color is Green")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

`react-select` is trying to be smart to give us the best user-experience possible. However, all this extra logic makes testing harder.

You now have two options.

You can figure out what DOM structure `react-select` creates and then use `container.querySelector` to find its elements and interact with them. It takes a while, but it should be possible. After you have done all of that, you have to hope that at every new release the `react-select` team doesn't change the DOM structure too much or you might have to update all your tests.

The other option is to trust that `react-select` is going to make a component that works and that your users can use. Based on that trust you can replace that component in your tests for a simpler one.

In my experience, the second option works well and is much easier to maintain.

How do you replace the custom select for an easier one though? With [`jest.mock`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestmockmodulename-factory-options).

In our case we want to replace `react-select` for a normal HTML `select` tag. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
// highlight-start
jest.mock("react-select", () => ({ options, value, onChange }) => {
  function handleChange(event) {
    const option = options.find(
      (option) => option.value === event.currentTarget.value
    );
    onChange(option);
  }

  return (
    <select data-testid="select" value={value} onChange={handleChange}>
      {options.map(({ label, value }) => (
        <option key={value} value={value}>
          {label}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
});
// highlight-end

test("Test with mock", () => {
  render(<MySelector />);
  expect(screen.getByText("Your favorite color is Red")).toBeInTheDocument();
  // highlight-start
  fireEvent.change(screen.getByTestId("select"), {
    target: { value: "green" },
  });
  // highlight-end
  expect(screen.getByText("Your favorite color is Green")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

I've added a `data-testid` to make it easy to find the `select` and implemented a `handleChange` handler that simulates the one from `react-select`. Your logic might change depending on what custom select you are using but the basic idea is the same.
