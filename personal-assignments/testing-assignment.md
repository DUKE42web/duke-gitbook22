  - Ask questions about the design if you have any
  - Go to `./src/components/NewsBanner`
  - Start building out the component, reference the `./docs` to understand the files to create and how to use them (composition, data, index, stories, test, types)
  - Be sure to make commits to your branch
  - When done, push all commits to remote and open a pull request

  ***

  - This is a full-width component.
  - It includes a visual, a title, a description, a CTA button and a background.
  - A title is required
  - Text that exceeds the available content space will be truncated.
  - The visual is required. An icon or image may be used as the supporting visual.
  - The height for the banner should be determined by the height of the content plus the top and bottom spacing. Therefore, banners including icons and images will vary in height.
  - On desktop, the max height of the banner with an icon is 140px. The max height of the banner with an image is 170px on desktop.
  - On mobile, the max height of the banner with an icon is 296px. The max height of the banner with an image is 324px on mobile.
  - The description and CTA button are optional.
  - The content area should be centered horizontally when when the CTA is not displayed.
  - There are predefined background options.
