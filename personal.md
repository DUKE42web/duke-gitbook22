Hi, I have a macbook air... is it at all possible for me to find a workaround that allows for me to run two external monitors in addition to the builtin one?

docking station

Yes two actually, but unfortunately the macbook air was the m1 chip was the one model apple made that doesn'â€Œt nativley support multiple screens. This is one of my first weeks, I think my manager said it was an accident and that I was supposed to be sent a macbook pro but I have no idea if that is still in the works. Various sources on the internet claim to have found workarounds but so far I have not been able to successfully replicate these 'â€Œhacks'â€Œ. If the firewall allowed me to cast via airplay then I think I could connect to my external displays wirelessly. As I speak this computer is driving three large external screens but all three are a mirror of each other with the only distinction being the builtin display which is not mirroring the other three screens.

is this your personal device

2:09 PM

no it is my duke device

2:10 PM

My personal computer is a pc which has no issue with this

so you want to be able to control multiple screens with airplay

2:10 PM

As a last resort

but duke firewall blocks that

2:11 PM

ideally I would be able to drive two or three external screens in the (extend... (as opposed to mirror))-display mode

2:13 PM

I don'â€Œt have much expertice but I figured someone else may have had this issue and found some other solution... like for instance an external gpu that can drive the extra screens ? idk tbh but prior to this job I got very comfortable with a three screen workflow and it isn'â€Œt the end of the world but going back down to two or one screens is a pretty significant inconvenience considering one is usually dedicated to a microsoft teams call / screen share

2:15 PM

I feel like I may be blowing this out of proportion... this is just a matter of preference that I have grown accustomed to and is not actually a necessity. I have a creeping fear that it may just not be possible with this computer.
