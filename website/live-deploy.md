I found two broken links on the home page... I don't know if that's subject to change.

So.....We updated the URLs as instructed in pilot, but I get the below screen when deep linking. Funny thing is that PROD - where we did not make the config change, works. We were told to update our URLs

Pilot/Prod change:\
"deep-link.baseurl": "https:
//duke-energy.com",\
"deep-link.legacy.baseurl": "https:
//duke-energy.com",

to:\
"deep-link.baseurl": "https:
//auth.duke-energy.com",\
"deep-link.legacy.baseurl": "https:
//auth.duke-energy.com",

Kosoglov, Janet E we do not run that script in production so any links are going to need to be fixed.
