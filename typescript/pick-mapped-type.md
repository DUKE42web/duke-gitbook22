# PICK Mapped Type

In this post you‚Äôll learn how to use [Pick in TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#picktype-keys) to help clean up your codebase and make your type management far easier and cleaner!

What is `Pick`? Pick is what‚Äôs known as a Mapped Type, and I‚Äôve covered other Mapped Types in my [TypeScript Masterclass course](https://ultimatecourses.com/learn/typescript-masterclass).

Here‚Äôs the syntax for `Pick`:

We pass in an existing `Type` and then declare the `Keys` we wish to ‚Äúpick‚Äù from the `Type`. Make sense? The `Keys` _have to_ exist on the `Type` for you to be able to ‚Äúpick‚Äù them, otherwise you‚Äôll see a TypeScript error.

> üõπ The opposite behaviour would be to use [TypeScript‚Äôs Omit type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys) instead.

Mapped Types allow us to dynamically construct new types from existing ones, creating a new type with new meaning. It allows us to create new types on the fly, without having to declare new types or interfaces.

For example, here is a common authentication service I‚Äôve been working on lately, written in [Angular](https://ultimatecourses.com/courses/angular) and Firebase:

```
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class AuthService {
  constructor() {}

  async create({ name, email, password }: any) {...}

  async login({ email, password }: any) {...}

  async resetPassword({ email }: any) {...}
}
```

You‚Äôll note that we are essentially using the same properties to ‚Äúcreate‚Äù, ‚Äúlogin‚Äù and ‚Äúreset‚Äù a password. We use a mixture of `name`, `email`, `password`.

How could we type this? ü§î

Using the `type` keyword we could separately construct each property we expect and the using an [Intersection Type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#intersection-types) to combine the types into new ones:

```typescript
type Name = { name: string };
type Email = { email: string };
type Password = { password: string };

type CreateUser = Name & Email & Password; // { name: string, email: string, password: string }
type LoginUser = Email & Password; // { email: string, password: string }
type ResetPassword = Email; // { email: string }
```

We could then do this to add the types in the correct places:

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class AuthService {
  constructor() {}

  async create({ name, email, password }: CreateUser) {...}

  async login({ email, password }: LoginUser) {...}

  async resetPassword({ email }: ResetPassword) {...}
}
```

This is okay for such simple usage, but you can imagine expanding your codebase with more complex features and suddenly things begin spiralling out of control into a `type` world of pain.

This is where `Pick` comes into play. I aim for minimal code. No code is good code!

As we‚Äôve looked at the syntax already, `Pick` accepts an existing `Type` and then the properties (`Keys`) that you‚Äôd like to ‚Äúpick‚Äù from it.

First, let‚Äôs create a `Credentials` type via an `interface`, which will replace our stack of `type` declarations and introduce some `Pick` magic:

```typescript
export interface Credentials {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}
```

First of all, this is far easier to read and manage.

Secondly, I prefer using an `interface` over a `type` unless I‚Äôm [composing more complex types](https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/typescript-interfaces-vs-types), which I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúcredentials‚Äù are particularly complex.

Using `Pick`, we can tell TypeScript _just to pick_ those particular `Keys` from our existing `Type` (which could be an `interface` or `type`).

This allows us to cleverly construct a new type from using `Pick`, but only use the relevant properties (ignoring the others):

```typescript
export interface Credentials {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class AuthService {
  constructor() {}

  async create({ name, email, password }: Credentials) {...}

  async login({ email, password }: Pick<Credentials, 'email' | 'password'>) {...}

  async resetPassword({ email }: Pick<Credentials, 'email'>) {...}
}
```

Far cleaner, and all the types are kept in a single place. If you‚Äôre likely to reuse them, you can of course break them out into `type` keywords as well which I‚Äôll show you momentarily.

> üö® Pro tip: Be careful not to confuse the `'email' | 'password'` with a [Union Type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#union-types). In a Mapped Type such as Pick, this `|` syntax is more ‚Äúand‚Äù instead of ‚Äúor‚Äù.

As an extra bonus, we'll also send you some extra goodies across a few extra emails.

If we were to in future change the `Credentials` interface, the new definitions will flow through the rest of the code, rather than us updating each Intersection Type manually.

`Pick` is a great utility [Mapped Type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html) that makes things lots easier for us, I highly encourage you to use it to your advantage to keep your codebase clean!

> üïµÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è You can also check out the brief [Pick documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#picktype-keys) if you‚Äôd like to as well.

And promised, here‚Äôs how you can create new types with the resulting `Pick` types, which would allow you to use them elsewhere without repeating the same code.

```
export interface Credentials {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

type LoginUser = Pick<Credentials, 'email' | 'password'>;
type ResetPassword = Pick<Credentials, 'email'>;
```

Either way, this is far easier to see! We also get added intellisense benefits with using an `interface` instead of a `type`.
