# Enums

### Enums

Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript.

Enums allow a developer to define a set of named
constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

### Numeric enums <a href="#numeric-enums" id="numeric-enums"></a>

We'll first start off with numeric enums, which are probably more familiar if you're coming from other languages. An enum can be defined using the `enum` keyword.

```
enum Direction {  Up = 1,  Down,  Left,  Right,}Try
```

Above, we have a numeric enum where `Up` is initialized with `1` . All of the following members are auto-incremented from that point on. In other words, `Direction.Up` has the value `1` , `Down` has `2` , `Left` has `3` , and `Right` has `4` .

If we wanted, we could leave off the initializers entirely:

```
enum Direction {  Up,  Down,  Left,  Right,}Try
```

Here, `Up` would have the value `0` , `Down` would have `1` , etc. This auto-incrementing behavior is useful for cases where we might not care about the member values themselves, but do care that each value is distinct from other values in the same enum.

Using an enum is simple: just access any member as a property off of the enum itself, and declare types using the name of the enum:

```ts
enum UserResponse {  No = 0,  Yes = 1,} function respond(recipient: string, message: UserResponse): void {
// ...} respond("Princess Caroline", UserResponse.Yes);Try
```

Numeric enums can be mixed in [computed and
constant members (see below)](https:
//www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#computed-and-
constant-members). The short story is, enums without initializers either need to be first, or have to come after numeric enums initialized with numeric
constants or other
constant enum members. In other words, the following isn't allowed:

```
enum E {  A = getSomeValue(),  B,Enum member must have initializer.Enum member must have initializer.}Try
```

### String enums <a href="#string-enums" id="string-enums"></a>

String enums are a similar concept, but have some subtle [runtime differences](https:
//www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#enums-at-runtime) as documented below. In a string enum, each member has to be
constant-initialized with a string literal, or with another string enum member.

```
enum Direction {  Up = "UP",  Down = "DOWN",  Left = "LEFT",  Right = "RIGHT",}Try
```

While string enums don't have auto-incrementing behavior, string enums have the benefit that they "serialize" well. In other words, if you were debugging and had to read the runtime value of a numeric enum, the value is often opaque - it doesn't convey any useful meaning on its own (though [reverse mapping](https:
//www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#reverse-mappings) can often help). String enums allow you to give a meaningful and readable value when your code runs, independent of the name of the enum member itself.

### Heterogeneous enums <a href="#heterogeneous-enums" id="heterogeneous-enums"></a>

Technically enums can be mixed with string and numeric members, but it's not clear why you would ever want to do so:

```
enum BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum {  No = 0,  Yes = "YES",}Try
```

Unless you're really trying to take advantage of JavaScript's runtime behavior in a clever way, it's advised that you don't do this.

### Computed and

constant members <a href="#computed-and-
constant-members" id="computed-and-
constant-members"></a>

Each enum member has a value associated with it which can be either _
constant_ or _computed_. An enum member is considered
constant if:

- It is the first member in the enum and it has no initializer, in which case it's assigned the value `0`:

````

// E.X is
constant:enum E {  X,}Try
    ```

*   It does not have an initializer and the preceding enum member was a _numeric_
constant. In this case the value of the current enum member will be the value of the preceding enum member plus one.
````

````typescript

// All enum members in 'E1' and 'E2' are
constant. enum E1 {  X,  Y,  Z,} enum E2 {  A = 1,  B,  C,}Try
```
````

- The enum member is initialized with a
  constant enum expression. A
  constant enum expression is a subset of TypeScript expressions that can be fully evaluated at compile time. An expression is a
  constant enum expression if it is:
  1. a literal enum expression (basically a string literal or a numeric literal)
  2. a reference to previously defined
     constant enum member (which can originate from a different enum)
  3. a parenthesized
     constant enum expression
  4. one of the `+`, `-`, `~` unary operators applied to
     constant enum expression
  5. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `&`, `|`, `^` binary operators with
     constant enum expressions as operands It is a compile time error for
     constant enum expressions to be evaluated to `NaN` or `Infinity` .

In all other cases enum member is considered computed.

```
enum FileAccess {
//
constant members  None,  Read = 1 << 1,  Write = 1 << 2,  ReadWrite = Read | Write,
// computed member  G = "123".length,}Try
```

### Union enums and enum member types <a href="#union-enums-and-enum-member-types" id="union-enums-and-enum-member-types"></a>

There is a special subset of
constant enum members that aren't calculated: literal enum members. A literal enum member is a
constant enum member with no initialized value, or with values that are initialized to

- any string literal (e.g. `"foo"`, `"bar`, `"baz"`)
- any numeric literal (e.g. `1`, `100`)
- a unary minus applied to any numeric literal (e.g. `-1`, `-100`)

When all members in an enum have literal enum values, some special semantics come into play.

The first is that enum members also become types as well! For example, we can say that certain members can _only_ have the value of an enum member:

```
enum ShapeKind {  Circle,  Square,} interface Circle {  kind: ShapeKind.Circle;  radius: number;} interface Square {  kind: ShapeKind.Square;  sideLength: number;} let c: Circle = {  kind: ShapeKind.Square,Type 'ShapeKind.Square' is not assignable to type 'ShapeKind.Circle'.Type 'ShapeKind.Square' is not assignable to type 'ShapeKind.Circle'.  radius: 100,};Try
```

The other change is that enum types themselves effectively become a _union_ of each enum member. With union enums, the type system is able to leverage the fact that it knows the exact set of values that exist in the enum itself. Because of that, TypeScript can catch bugs where we might be comparing values incorrectly. For example:

```ts
enum E {  Foo,  Bar,} function f(x: E) {  if (x !== E.Foo || x !== E.Bar) {This condition will always return 'true' since the types 'E.Foo' and 'E.Bar' have no overlap.This condition will always return 'true' since the types 'E.Foo' and 'E.Bar' have no overlap.
//  }}Try
```

In that example, we first checked whether `x` was _not_ `E.Foo` . If that check succeeds, then our `||` will short-circuit, and the body of the â€˜if' will run. However, if the check didn't succeed, then `x` can _only_ be `E.Foo` , so it doesn't make sense to see whether it's equal to `E.Bar` .

### Enums at runtime <a href="#enums-at-runtime" id="enums-at-runtime"></a>

Enums are real objects that exist at runtime. For example, the following enum

```ts
enum E {
  X,
  Y,
  Z,
}
Try;
```

can actually be passed around to functions

```ts
enum E {
  X,
  Y,
  Z,
}
function f(obj: { X: number }) {
  return obj.X;
}
// Works, since 'E' has a property named 'X' which is a number.f(E);Try
```

### Enums at compile time <a href="#enums-at-compile-time" id="enums-at-compile-time"></a>

Even though Enums are real objects that exist at runtime, the `keyof` keyword works differently than you might expect for typical objects. Instead, use `keyof typeof` to get a Type that represents all Enum keys as strings.

```
enum LogLevel {  ERROR,  WARN,  INFO,  DEBUG,} /** * This is equivalent to: * type LogLevelStrings = 'ERROR' | 'WARN' | 'INFO' | 'DEBUG'; */type LogLevelStrings = keyof typeof LogLevel; function printImportant(key: LogLevelStrings, message: string) {
const num = LogLevel[key];  if (num <= LogLevel.WARN) {    console.log("Log level key is:", key);    console.log("Log level value is:", num);    console.log("Log level message is:", message);  }}printImportant("ERROR", "This is a message");Try
```

#### Reverse mappings <a href="#reverse-mappings" id="reverse-mappings"></a>

In addition to creating an object with property names for members, numeric enums members also get a _reverse mapping_ from enum values to enum names. For example, in this example:

```ts
enum Enum {
  A,
}
let a = Enum.A;
let nameOfA = Enum[a];
// "A"Try
```

TypeScript compiles this down to the following JavaScript:

```ts
"use strict";
var Enum;
(function (Enum) {
  Enum[(Enum["A"] = 0)] = "A";
})(Enum || (Enum = {}));
let a = Enum.A;
let nameOfA = Enum[a];
// "A" Try
```

In this generated code, an enum is compiled into an object that stores both forward ( `name` -> `value` ) and reverse ( `value` -> `name` ) mappings. References to other enum members are always emitted as property accesses and never inlined.

Keep in mind that string enum members _do not_ get a reverse mapping generated at all.

#### `

const` enums <a href="#
const-enums" id="
const-enums"></a>

In most cases, enums are a perfectly valid solution. However sometimes requirements are tighter. To avoid paying the cost of extra generated code and additional indirection when accessing enum values, it's possible to use ` const` enums.
const enums are defined using the ` const` modifier on our enums:

```ts
const enum Enum {
  A = 1,
  B = A * 2,
}
Try;
```

const enums can only use
constant enum expressions and unlike regular enums they are completely removed during compilation.
const enum members are inlined at use sites. This is possible since
const enums cannot have computed members.

```ts
const enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
let directions = [
  Direction.Up,
  Direction.Down,
  Direction.Left,
  Direction.Right,
];
Try;
```

in generated code will become

```ts
"use strict";
let directions = [0 /* Up */, 1 /* Down */, 2 /* Left */, 3 /* Right */];
Try;
```

**
const enum pitfalls**

Inlining enum values is straightforward at first, but comes with subtle implications. These pitfalls pertain to _ambient_
const enums only (basically
const enums in `.d.ts` files) and sharing them between projects, but if you are publishing or consuming `.d.ts` files, these pitfalls likely apply to you, because `tsc --declaration` transforms `.ts` files into `.d.ts` files.

1. For the reasons laid out in the [`isolatedModules` documentation](https:
   //www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#references-to-
   const-enum-members), that mode is fundamentally incompatible with ambient
   const enums. This means if you publish ambient
   const enums, downstream consumers will not be able to use [`isolatedModules`](https:
   //www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules) and those enum values at the same time.
2. You can easily inline values from version A of a dependency at compile time, and import version B at runtime. Version A and B's enums can have different values, if you are not very careful, resulting in [surprising bugs](https:
   //github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5219#issue-110947903), like taking the wrong branches of `if` statements. These bugs are especially pernicious because it is common to run automated tests at roughly the same time as projects are built, with the same dependency versions, which misses these bugs completely.
3. [`importsNotUsedAsValues: "preserve"`](https:
   //www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importsNotUsedAsValues) will not elide imports for
   const enums used as values, but ambient
   const enums do not guarantee that runtime `.js` files exist. The unresolvable imports cause errors at runtime. The usual way to unambiguously elide imports, [type-only imports](https:
   //www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#importing-types), [does not allow
   const enum values](https:
   //github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/40344), currently.

Here are two approaches to avoiding these pitfalls:

A. Do not use
const enums at all. You can easily [ban
const enums](https:
//github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/docs/getting-started/linting/FAQ.md#how-can-i-ban-specific-language-feature) with the help of a linter. Obviously this avoids any issues with
const enums, but prevents your project from inlining its own enums. Unlike inlining enums from other projects, inlining a project's own enums is not problematic and has performance implications. B. Do not publish ambient
const enums, by de
constifying them with the help of [`preserve
constEnums` ](https:
//www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#preserve
constEnums). This is the approach taken internally by the [TypeScript project itself](https:
//github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/5422). [`preserve
constEnums` ](https:
//www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#preserve
constEnums)emits the same JavaScript for
const enums as plain enums. You can then safely strip the ` const` modifier from `.d.ts` files [in a build step](https:
//github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/1a981d1df1810c868a66b3828497f049a944951c/Gulpfile.js#L144).

This way downstream consumers will not inline enums from your project, avoiding the pitfalls above, but a project can still inline its own enums, unlike banning
const enums entirely.

### Ambient enums <a href="#ambient-enums" id="ambient-enums"></a>

Ambient enums are used to describe the shape of already existing enum types.

```
declare enum Enum {  A = 1,  B,  C = 2,}Try
```

One important difference between ambient and non-ambient enums is that, in regular enums, members that don't have an initializer will be considered
constant if its preceding enum member is considered
constant. By contrast, an ambient (and non-
const) enum member that does not have an initializer is _always_ considered computed.

### Objects vs Enums <a href="#objects-vs-enums" id="objects-vs-enums"></a>

In modern TypeScript, you may not need an enum when an object with `as const` could suffice:

```typescript

const enum EDirection {  Up,  Down,  Left,  Right,}
const ODirection = {  Up: 0,  Down: 1,  Left: 2,  Right: 3,} as
const; EDirection.Up;           (enum member) EDirection.Up = 0 ODirection.Up;           (property) Up: 0
// Using the enum as a parameterfunction walk(dir: EDirection) {}
// It requires an extra line to pull out the valuestype Direction = typeof ODirection[keyof typeof ODirection];function run(dir: Direction) {} walk(EDirection.Left);run(ODirection.Right);Try
```
