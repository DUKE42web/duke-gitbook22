## Our "Definition of Done" for a Component

You will know your component is complete if it is properly formatted, you have the requisite files outlined in the previous section (where applicable), and your files are free of TypeScript and ESLint warnings. Additionally, the appearance of the component should match the look of the Abstract design if one is provided, and if any Acceptance Criteria is provided, that should be met as well. We prioritize accessibility as well, so your component should pass \[WCAG2.1 a11y requirements]\(https: //www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/). This can be validated via the Storybook plugin we have set up, as well as in the browser using Lighthouse.

Lastly, you will need to have written some unit tests to check the core functionality of your component and ensure that those are passing.

### Checklist

- [ ] match the appearance of the Abstract file from the Design team
- [ ] address any provided Acceptance Criteria
