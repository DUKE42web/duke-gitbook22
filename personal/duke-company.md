LAN IDs, Employee IDs, and Responsibility Codes do not currently show in modern search on a person's profile card. Please use our specialized People Search Page or access the information in Delve.

The Portal is your default home page when you launch the Internet on your Duke Energy workstation. You can also access the Portal from your personal laptop or mobile device.

The Portal is a robust communication tool designed to be informative and engaging. On the home page, top company stories and employee features are posted frequently. The home page also contains media articles, company events, and personnel announcements. You are encouraged to add comments to articles and submit company-sponsored events and accomplishments.

The Portal also provides access to key transactional items such as company facts and branding, HR information (e.g., benefits and pay), policies, services (e.g., mail service and expense management), departments, operations, and other tools and applications.

### Manage Your Information

Delve profile pages exist for everyone with a LAN ID who is an employee of or contingent worker for Duke Energy.

Where did my profile information come from?

The organizational and location information in your Delve Portal profile comes from Active Directory.

This section of your Delve Profile is optional. You can choose to enter additional information about yourself, including:

- About me
- Home phone
- Projects
- Skills and expertise
- Schools and education
- Interests and hobbies

Filling in this information will help others find you when they're looking for someone with knowledge or experience about your areas of expertise, or it can help you connect with others who share your interests.

To edit this information, go to your [Delve profile](https://dukeenergy-my.sharepoint.com/person.aspx) and click the Update Profile button.

Manage Your Photo in Workday

Manage Your Photo in O365

Instructions for O365 Photos

When you go to Delve, click Me in the left navigation. Use the camera icon over your photo to change your picture. This will change it throughout the O365 environment, including Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint. Changing your photo here will not push it to Workday. Work is underway to enable the Workforce Photo Tool to integrate with O365.

**Photo Guidelines**

Your photo must be business-appropriate. That would be:

- A forward-facing, head-and-shoulders shot of you without sunglasses, ball cap, kids or family dog serves as a good starting point. Consider the limited space that will display your face when you select a photo. The goal is to see what you look like!
- Please follow copyright rules when selecting a photo to update. You must own rights to any image you post.

### **PORTAL GUIDE**

### Accessing the Portal Remotely

You can access the Portal from any computer or mobile device. You do not need to be on the Duke Energy network, and you do not need to use a Duke Energy computer or device that is in the Personal Mobile Device program.

**From the SharePoint App**

- You can download the SharePoint app from an app store. The home icon in the app takes you to the Portal homepage.

**From a Mobile Browser**

- Open your web browser (i.e., Edge, Chrome or a similar Web browser)
- Type [https://dukeenergy.sharepoint.com/sites/portal](https://dukeenergy.sharepoint.com/sites/portal) in the address bar at the top of your Web browser and press Enter.
- If you are not on the network or on a device managed through the Personal Mobile Device program, you will need to log into your Office 365 account.
- Enter your LAN ID and password.
- Follow the steps required for your multi-factored authentication (MFA). This is most likely a phone call to the number you entered when you created your Office 365 profile. For questions, [call the Help Desk](https://dukeenergy.sharepoint.com/sites/portal/tools-resources/enterprise-help-desk).

Keep in mind that some Duke Energy applications, are not available when you are off the network, and you will experience errors if you click links to them.
